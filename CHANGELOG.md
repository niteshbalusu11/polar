# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. See [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) for commit guidelines.

## [1.4.0](https://github.com/jamaljsr/polar/compare/v1.3.0...v1.4.0)

While Polar has kept up with the new node implementation releases via the out-of-band updates, it hasn't had any new features added in a long while. This release packages up all those node updates so that you don't need to manually update after the initial install. We now also have automatic updates. You can opt-in to checking for new node versions on startup, instead of having to do it manually. Links to check for updates have also been added to the start screen and footer to make it easier to get to.

There are a bunch of first-time contributors in this release. They've added some great updates which you can see listed below. Thank you all for your PRs.

This release is required to run Core Lightning v0.12.0 due to an API that Polar requires being deprecated.

This is a minor release which adds a small set of improvements and fixes some bugs. All of the node implementations have been updated to their latest versions.

This release is required to run Bitcoin Core v0.21.0 nodes due to a small breaking change. The default wallet is no longer created automatically during `bitcoind` startup, so Polar must create the wallet once `bitcoind` comes online.

## [v1.0.0](https://github.com/jamaljsr/polar/compare/v0.2.1...v1.0.0)

This release was focused on implementing many of the feature requests submitted since the first release, as well as adding support for the Eclair Lightning implementation. You can now use your own custom Docker image, allowing you to run the master branch or your personal fork of each node. Polar now supports importing and exporting networks, which allows you to save snapshots to reuse as a starting point over an over again. We also added a log viewer for nodes which should make it easier to see what your nodes are doing and added right-click menus for nodes & channels so you can perform actions with less clicks. To support more flexible environments, the Lightning P2P and Bitcoin ZMQ ports are now exposed to the host machine, which means you can have nodes outside of Polar communicate with the nodes inside.

I am bumping the version to a major release v1.0.0 to signify that I feel Polar is now pretty stable and fully-functional, with support for the big three Lightning implementations. There are still more improvements which will be added in the future, but what's included now is a solid base.

### Features

- Make bitcoind's ZeroMQ servers reachable on LAN ([#297](https://github.com/jamaljsr/polar/pull/297)) by [@hsjoberg](https://github.com/hsjoberg)
- Make lightning nodes p2p port reachable on LAN ([#301](https://github.com/jamaljsr/polar/pull/301)) by [@hsjoberg](https://github.com/hsjoberg)
- Add right-click menus for nodes and channels ([#312](https://github.com/jamaljsr/polar/pull/312))

## [v0.2.1](https://github.com/jamaljsr/polar/compare/v0.2.0...v0.2.1)

This is just a small release to bring back light mode for those who prefer it over dark mode.

### Features

- **ui:** add light/dark mode toggle ([#280](https://github.com/jamaljsr/polar/pull/280))

### Bug Fixes

- **ui:** lighten node background in dark mode ([2a5fde4](https://github.com/jamaljsr/polar/commit/2a5fde4925d4224c5e239bdfb8450391ab2e07b6))

### Docs

- fix spelling and add Polar version field to bug template ([#279](https://github.com/jamaljsr/polar/pull/279)) h/t [@bolatovumar](https://github.com/bolatovumar)

## [v0.2.0](https://github.com/jamaljsr/polar/compare/v0.1.0...v0.2.0)

This release was focused on adding core features that didn't make it in the first release, as well as some UX and stability improvements. The UI has been redesigned to use a dark theme which has been a popular request. Polar now supports the latest versions of LND v0.8.2, Bitcoin Core v0.19.0.1 and adds support for c-lightning v0.8.0. Future released versions of these Lightning & Bitcoin nodes can now be used without needing to release a new version of Polar. This feature will let you start using the new versions as soon as they are out. To maintain support for older LND versions which are not compatible with the latest bitcoind, Polar now supports running multiple bitcoin nodes in a single network. Have fun creating chain splits and block reorgs with the new ability to stop and start individual nodes as well :)

There are now 10 languages included (English, French, German, Spanish, Russian, Italian, Chinese Simplified, Portuguese-Brazilian, Japanese, Korean), though most are machine generated, so they need some love. Languages are now crowd-sourced via Crowdin. See the [Help Translate](https://github.com/jamaljsr/polar#help-translate) section of the README for more details.

In the next release, the focus will be on tackling some of the feature requests submitted since the initial launch. If you have any suggestions or use-cases you'd like to see improved with Polar, please don't hesitate to open an issue.

### Application Data Folder Moved

**Be sure to stop all your running networks and close Polar v0.1.0 before installing v0.2.0!**

When adding c-lighting v0.8.0, lightningd was unable to create the lightning-rpc socket file due to 'path too long' errors on Mac. Polar previously stored the data for nodes in `~/Library/Application Support/polar/data/networks/`. This has now been changed to `~/.polar` on all OS's. When you launch v0.2.0 for the first time, Polar will migrate your application data from the old folder location to the new location. This also means that the paths to certs & macaroons have changed. If you hard-coded them in your app, you'll need to update the paths.

Location in v0.1.0

- Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/polar/data/networks/`
- Linux: `~/config/polar/data/networks/`
- Windows: `~/AppData/Roaming/polar/data/networks/`

New location in v0.2.0

- All OS's: `~/.polar/networks/`

### Features

- **ui**: change ui design to use dark mode ([#271](https://github.com/jamaljsr/polar/pull/271))
- **network**: add support for c-lightning v0.8.0 with [c-lightning-REST](https://github.com/Ride-The-Lightning/c-lightning-REST) plugin ([#259](https://github.com/jamaljsr/polar/pull/259))

- **network**: add support for Bitcoin Core v0.19.0.1 ([#257](https://github.com/jamaljsr/polar/pull/257))
- **docker**: add ability to update future Bitcoin & Lightning node versions in-between Polar releases ([#267](https://github.com/jamaljsr/polar/pull/267))
- **network**: add ability to run multiple Bitcoin Core nodes in one network ([#257](https://github.com/jamaljsr/polar/pull/257))

- **i18n**: add translations for 9 languages via Crowdin ([#261](https://github.com/jamaljsr/polar/pull/261))

### Bug Fixes

- **ui**: disable "Close channel" button if opening channel to self ([#247](https://github.com/jamaljsr/polar/issues/247)), closes [#246](https://github.com/jamaljsr/polar/issues/246) by [@bolatovumar](https://github.com/bolatovumar)
